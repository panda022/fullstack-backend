# fullstack-backend
Refactor my post webiste project backend using spring boot framework.
This project will create full stack CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring boot and React 
Components. Finally, the project will build Web Services (REST API) using Spring and Mysql on Backend 
and Test using PostMan and then handle the same REST API on react in frontend using axios.

As a second year computer science student, I learned many academic courses like intro to web development(html, css,javascrpt),oop(Java),intro to database.
I would like to combine all I learned to apply them to real world --- build my own blog webiste, implements features including the crud of post and comment,
the crud od users and roles, authentication and authorization. With the help of spring framwork, I do not need to build everything from scratch
as I standing on the shoulders of giants(Great Software Engineers).


## The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
- Building a REST API
- Spring Core
- Springboot
- Spring JPA
- Spring Security-MVC Architectural Patter-Java

During this development, I learned the following concept:
- Dependency injection
- Repository design pattern
- Mysql
- Entity 
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) & AutoMapper
- RESTful API guidelines
- HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
- Views (React concept)
- Testing API Endpoints (SwaggerUI & Postman)
- Amazon (Deployment: EC2， RDS)
- Docker (Container, Image, Deploying on Docker Hub)
